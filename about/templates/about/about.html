            <p>
                Tutor Line was created to make it easier for families and students to find the right tutor with confidence. 
                The platform brings clarity, organisation, and transparency to the tutoring process, helping users connect 
                with educators who match their needs, values, and learning goals.

            <p>
                The mission of Tutor Line is to empower both learners and tutors by providing a simple, reliable space where 
                accurate information, thoughtful presentation, and professional communication come together. Every profile is 
                designed to highlight a tutor’s strengths clearly, making it easier for users to make informed decisions.

            <p>
                Tutor Line also aims to support tutors by giving them tools to present themselves professionally, showcase 
                their experience, and build trust with potential clients. The platform reflects a commitment to clarity, 
                fairness, and meaningful educational connections.
